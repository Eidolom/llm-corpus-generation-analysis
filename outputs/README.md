# Outputs Directory

This folder contains generated results from the analysis pipeline.

## Generated Files

### Sentence Data
- `intermediate_sentences.json` - Register-controlled generated sentences (SCC)
- `pos_tagging_results.json` - Verb-filtered sentences with POS tags

### Semantic Analysis Results
- `thesis_semantic_data_final.csv` - Main results with LITERAL/IDIOMATIC labels

**Note:** Raw analysis outputs (`semantic_analysis_results.json`, `semantic_analysis_summary.csv`) are stored in the `data/` folder (protected from public git commit) due to their dependence on TEC corpus data.

### Visualizations
- `results_aggregate_chart.png` - Stacked bar chart by register
- `results_heatmap.png` - Per-lemma heatmap of idiomatic rates

## Git LFS

Large files (*.csv, *.json, *.png) are tracked via Git LFS. See [.gitattributes](../.gitattributes) for patterns.

## Reproducibility

These files are generated by the pipeline scripts and can be reproduced by running the workflow from scratch.
